### Contents

The repository contains the code for training the models for recognizing the vibrational signals of several species as described in our paper *Computational methods for detecting insect vibrational signals in field vibroscape recordings* (see ref. below). 

The models were trained on the <a href="https://github.com/matijama/vibroscape">VibroScape dataset</a>. 

### Cite us
The paper describing the dataset and our first automatic classification methods is published in Ecological Informatics. Please cite  [(Marolt et al. 2025)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2025.103003) if you use this code or dataset.
